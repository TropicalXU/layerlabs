        First we will create a roadmap. Designing a timeline for the website and its launch. This is important to establish first to get a sense of what we can do in that time. We will implement a schedule to communicate througout the process.
        Next we will gather all materials including images, text, videos and other sources of content to include in the website. At this point we will discuss branding including logos and text. Lastly we will establish a deadline a date to launch 
        the website.

        Let's talk design, designing a clean, interactive and responsive website is what sets a Layerlabs website from the rest. First we will establish a custom theme including page design, color palettes and text design. Next we will create a 
        brand logo which will be used throughout the website along with text. Lastly we will map out the placement of the content and implement it into the design.

      <p style="color: white;font-size: 18px;">
        I will build a robust framework for the application implementing fully handwritten code unique to the website including libaries and tools to provide support across all browsers. I will ensure the design is fully responsive across every device including desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile.
        Another key aspect of the design will be mapping out easy to navigate tools with the user in mind. Next I will administer Search Engine Optimization(SEO) so that the application is fully screen readable and enhances organic discovery and website traffic within search tools such as Safari and Chrome.
        Lastly I will install full security within the website and domain so that the application is fully secure protecting yourself and your users data from any malicious attempts.

        The final part of the roadmap, this includes reviewing all material making sure everyting has been included. After reviewing the application the website will be fully tested in the browser eliminating any issue that may arise.
        Once everything has been tested we can launch the website. Communication and ongoing support will be provided if requested if there are any updates or changes needed for the application.
